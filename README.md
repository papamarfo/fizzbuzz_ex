# Fizzbuzz

Write an Elixir application that outputs Fizzbuzz starting from 1 every 2 seconds

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, print "buzz" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Fizzbuzz" instead of the number.
